# RoombaNet

A .NET application for local control of iRobot devices via MQTT, without relying on cloud services.

## 🤖 Compatibility

### Tested Devices
- **Roomba i3** ✅ Fully tested and confirmed working

### Potentially Compatible Models
Based on MQTT protocol support, the following models should work but are untested:

**i-series** (entry to mid-tier with smart features)
- i1, i2, i3, i4, i5, i6, i7, i8

**j-series** (advanced with object recognition)
- j7, j7+, j9, j9+

**s-series** (premium with D-shaped design)
- s9, s9+

**900 series** (older premium models)
- 960, 980

**600 series** (budget models with Wi-Fi)
- 690, 695, 698 (if equipped with Wi-Fi)

**Braava** (mopping robots)
- Jet m6

**Note**: Models without Wi-Fi connectivity or those using only Bluetooth are not supported.

### Connection Requirements
- Local network connectivity required
- MQTT protocol support (most Wi-Fi enabled Roombas from 2016+)
- No cloud services required - all communication stays on your local network
- **⚠️ Single connection limit**: Roombas only allow one active MQTT connection at a time. If you start a second instance (CLI, API, or mobile app), the previous connection will be disconnected. This is a hardware limitation of the Roomba, not this application.

## 🌟 Features

### Core Capabilities
- **CLI Tool**
- **RESTful API**
- **Real-time Status Streaming**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live status updates
- **Local Communication**: Direct MQTT connection to your Roomba
- **Privacy-Focused**: All communication stays on your local network

### Supported Commands
- `find` - Make the Roomba beep to locate it
- `start` - Start a cleaning mission
- `stop` - Stop the current cleaning mission
- `pause` - Pause the cleaning mission
- `resume` - Resume a paused mission
- `dock` - Return to charging dock
- `evac` - Empty bin into Clean Base (models with auto-evacuation only)
- `reset` - Reset Roomba to factory settings
- `train` - Start a training run for mapping

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 10.0 or later
- Roomba connected to your local network
- Roomba BLID and password (see configuration section)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imilosk/RoombaNet.git
cd RoombaNet
dotnet build
```

### Configuration

#### Step 1: Discover Your Roomba

First, find your Roomba on the network to get its IP address and BLID:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/RoombaNet.Cli discover
```

This will display information like:
```
Found 1 Roomba(s):

Name:          My Roomba
BLID:          1234567890ABCDEF
IP Address:    192.168.1.100
Hostname:      Roomba-1234567890ABCDEF
MAC Address:   AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
SKU/Model:     i355020
```

#### Step 2: Get Your Roomba Password

The process varies by model:

**For i3, i3+, and similar models:**
1. Press and hold both the **HOME** and **SPOT CLEAN** buttons for about 2 seconds until you hear a sound and the CLEAN button turns blue
2. The Roomba will create its own Wi-Fi network (e.g., "Roomba-XXXXXXXX")
3. Connect your computer to the Roomba's Wi-Fi network
4. Run discovery again to get the Roomba's IP on its own network:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project src/RoombaNet.Cli discover
   ```
5. Get the password using the new IP address:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project src/RoombaNet.Cli get password --ip 192.168.10.1
   ```
   (The IP is typically `192.168.10.1` on the Roomba's network)
6. Reconnect to your regular Wi-Fi network

**For other models:**
1. Place Roomba on the dock
2. Hold the HOME button for about 2 seconds until it plays a series of tones (about 6 beeps)
3. Run the command immediately:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project src/RoombaNet.Cli get password --ip 192.168.1.100
   ```

Replace `192.168.1.100` with your Roomba's IP address from step 1.

#### Step 3: Create Configuration File

Create a `secrets.Development.json` file in the `src/RoombaNet.Settings/` directory with the information from steps 1 and 2:

```json
{
  "RoombaSettings": {
    "Ip": "192.168.1.100",
    "Port": 8883,
    "Blid": "1234567890ABCDEF",
    "Password": "your_roomba_password_from_step_2"
  }
}
```

## 📖 Usage Examples

### CLI Commands

Run the CLI tool with different commands:

```bash
# Discover Roombas on your network
dotnet run --project src/RoombaNet.Cli discover

# Get Roomba password (hold HOME button for 2 seconds first)
dotnet run --project src/RoombaNet.Cli get password

# Make the Roomba beep (find command)
dotnet run --project src/RoombaNet.Cli execute find

# Start cleaning
dotnet run --project src/RoombaNet.Cli execute start

# Return to dock
dotnet run --project src/RoombaNet.Cli execute dock

# Subscribe to all Roomba events and messages
dotnet run --project src/RoombaNet.Cli subscribe

# Get current settings
dotnet run --project src/RoombaNet.Cli get

# Change settings (e.g., enable two-pass cleaning)
dotnet run --project src/RoombaNet.Cli setting twoPass true

# Get help and see all available commands
dotnet run --project src/RoombaNet.Cli --help
```

Example output when using the `execute` command:
```
🔍 Sending 'find' command to Roomba...
✅ Command 'find' sent successfully
🤖 Roomba should now be beeping!
```

Example output when using the `subscribe` command:
```
👂 Listening for Roomba messages... (Press Ctrl+C to exit)
